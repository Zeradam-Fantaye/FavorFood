Difference between authentication and authorization:

    => Authentication is finding out if someone is who they say they are
    
    => Authorization is once you figure out who someone is, you figure out if they are allowed to do something
    => Think of authorization as permission. 
            => What is that user allowed to do?
            => What is their security clearance?
                    => You can't view the edit form unless you own the campground
